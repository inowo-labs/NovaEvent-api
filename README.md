# NovaEvents API

Off-chain API for NovaEvents — handles indexing, notifications, and media for the Stellar event platform.

The smart contract is the source of truth for all on-chain state. This API layers on top of it to provide faster queries, event-driven notifications, and services that can't run on-chain.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Set up environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your values
```

### Run in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
# API runs at http://localhost:3001
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express
- **Language:** TypeScript

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |
| `GET` | `/api/events` | List all events |
| `GET` | `/api/events/:id` | Get event by ID |
| `GET` | `/api/events/:id/tiers` | Get ticket tiers for an event |
| `GET` | `/api/events/:id/sponsorships` | Get all sponsorships for an event |
| `GET` | `/api/events/:id/tickets/:ticketId` | Get ticket by ID |

All write operations (buy ticket, sponsor, create event) happen directly on-chain through the contract — not through this API.

## Open for contributors

- Integrate `@stellar/stellar-sdk` to query the contract
- Index events into a local database for fast listing
- Email / push notifications for ticket purchases and event updates
- Image upload endpoint for event media (S3 or similar)
